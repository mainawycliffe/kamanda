# Kamanda - A Firebase CLI Companion Tool

This tool is meant to provide additional functionality not provided by Firebase
CLI such as Managing Users of your Projects, Exporting and Importing of Cloud
Firestore Data.

> This is not meant to replace Firebase CLI but to compliment it.

## Work in Progress

Its still an early work in progress, I hope to wrap the first few features in
the coming weeks.

## Contributors

Contributions are always welcome.

## Roadmap

This is currently our roadmap, please feel free to request additions/changes.

| Cloud Firestore  | ðŸ”œ       |
| Firebase Storage | ðŸ”œ       |

### Currently Working On

I am currently working on Firebase authentication. As of now, the tool can:

- Delete User(s)
- Add Users (Custom Claims Supported)
  - Add Single User
  - Add Users from a Yaml/JSON File
  - Add Custom Claims to a User ID
- Get User (WIP)
- List Firebase Auth Users (WIP)
