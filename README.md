# Firebase CLI

I am creating this tool as a companion for the official Firebase CLI Tool. I started creating this tool because I realized that as a Firebase developer, it is frustrating when trying to create a new default user, especially with a custom claim for a new project. I am hoping this tools help me and others interested to manage Firebase their Firebase accounts.
